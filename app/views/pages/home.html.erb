        <p>VEX Robotics offers students a way to test out robotics while giving a simplified version of the engineering process allowing for a fulfilling learning process that gives students a chance to practice marketing, programming, and building. VEX is better for those who like having a set structure but enjoying exploring the possibilities of design. VEX also has roles for those who don’t want to work directly on the robot by providing options to do scouting and marketing themselves to other teams to build alliances.</p>

        <p>Skills Robotics (Skills Canada) offers students a chance to push the boundaries of engineering by giving students a safe learning environment where they are taught to use machinery and their brains to solve the unique challenges thrown at them. Skills provides students with a chance to hone in their machining skills, while also developing upon their critical thinking, time management, ingenuity, and a perseverance skills. While Skills is usually open to those who have used machinery as it requires a degree of skill those who show a desire to learn may be accepted.</p>

        <p>CETA (Computer Engineering Teachers Association) and FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) are other robotics events that Warrior Robotix takes part in. CETA revolves around the idea of taken a simple robot and being able to program it to do a certain task such as line following. FRC is what many regard as the most highly recognized robotics event and it is similar to Skills Robotics in that the design is completely up to the team and how they want to build it but also programming it.</p>

      Warrior Robotix aims to create skills for the workforce that students can apply anywhere, but also skills required for daily life, like making quick decisive choices, communicating ideas effectively, and fostering healthy relationships with other people through the challenges brought on  by engineering and the companionship that comes with a team. We aim to not only Design-Build-Win at robotics but also at life.

    <div class="text-description">
      VEX Robotics Competition Nothing But Net is played on a 12’x12’ square field configured as seen in the video. Two alliances – one “red” and one “blue” – composed of two teams each, compete in matches consisting of a fifteen second autonomous period followed by one minute and forty-five seconds of driver-controlled play.
      <br/><br/>
      The objective of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing Alliance by Scoring your Balls and Bonus Balls in your Low and High Goals, and by Elevating Robots in your Climbing Zone.

      VEX Skyrise was the latest challenge thrust upon us. The premise was fairly simple, putting cubes on to posts that dotted the edges of the arena. However, there were also yellow pegs called skyrises that could be stacked upon to create a 5 foot tall tower! Additional cubes can then be placed on these skyrises for even more points. During the first competition we were on a slow start but managed to make it to the quarterfinals, we also won the Judges Award. We tweaked around our design and despite some issues we managed to make it to the semi-finals and play five tiebreaker rounds before losing. 2 weeks were spent rebuilding and it paid off when we won the next competition and two additional awards: Programming Skills and The Think. Having achieved our berth in the provincials we had another competition left. We ended up winning the tournament and taking home another two awards: Robot Skills and Excellence. When we made it to the provincials we ended up in the semi-finals and won the Innovate award. Also, due to our proficiency in robot and programming skills we were invited to the World Championships in Louisville, Kentucky. The next two months were devoted to practice, refinement,  and scouting. During the competition we did exceptionally well and made it to the Division Finals before losing to the team who would be the champions. While upset that we didn’t win we know that much more for the next competition: Nothing but Net!
